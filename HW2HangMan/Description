Homework 2 HLT: NLTK Hangman 
This project takes in any txt document, and plays hangman with the 50 most 
common nouns longer than 5 letters in that document. 
To run the program, you must pip install NLTK first. 
Then, simply place the .txt of your choice, must contain at least 50 unique nouns, 
in the same folder as the .py program. Then simply run the program from the 
command line with the .txt filename as an argument. 
From there instructions are available inside the game. 
This program utilizes POS tagging, lemmatization, and input filtering to achieve 
this word bank for the game.
